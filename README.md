# 💻 100DaysOfInterviewCodingChallenge
My journey through 100 days of coding interview preparation — solving LeetCode, GFG, and other DSA problems in Python.

All solutions are implemented in **Python 3** 🐍.

Each folder (Day 1 → Day 100) contains:
- Problem practising websites (LeetCode,GeeksForGeeks)
- Clean, commented Python solutions
- Daily learnings summary
