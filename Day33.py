Day 33 — Linked List

1. LeetCode 19: Remove Nth Node From End of List

Problem:
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Code (Python):

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        fast = slow = dummy

        for i in range(n + 1):
            fast = fast.next

        while fast:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next

        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return dummy.next
```

2. LeetCode 83: Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

Problem:
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates so that each element appears only once.

Code (Python):

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        current = head

        while current and current.next:
            if current.val == current.next.val:
                current.next = current.next.next
            else:
                current = current.next

        return head
```
